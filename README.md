# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to figure out how many employees are going to be retiring soon from Pewlett Hackard. The analysis needed to find all the current employees that are soon to be retired and figure out which departments are going be hiring new employees. This also needed to show which employees could mentor the new employees that will be coming in. 

## Results
The results show that there are quite a few employees that are going to be eligible for retirment very soon so they will need to get ready to hire in case they decide to retire:
- The code below finds all employees that are ready for retirement soon and gets their title. This problem with this is that it includes employees that are no longer with the company.

- I had to further filter the employees down to find all current employees using the code below.

## Summary
